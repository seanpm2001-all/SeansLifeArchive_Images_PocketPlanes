# SeansLifeArchive_Images_PocketPlanes
The module for my life story project that contains my Pocket Planes gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly Pocket Planes session pictures. I currently intend to play the [Android version (doesn't exist anymore yet)](http://nimblebit.com/) there is only a version available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-planes-airline-management/id491994942) at the moment. As of November 9th 2020, I still can't play the Android version.

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Pocket Planes all the way back in 2013. I played it on iOS from 2013 to 2013. I didn't have too much of an interest for it at the time.

I intend to start playing the game again on the same day I play Pocket Trains once an Android re-release comes out. The mobage version shut down in 2015, and NimbleBit still hasn't remade the game for Android as of November 9th 2020.
